My life started at 4 am on a Saturday when I enjoyed my first weekend :)</p><br> I had an equilibrated childhood and I was a brilliant pupil at Sahnoon-II primary school in my hometown. By the age of 12, I started my studies at Ibn Charaf preparation school for three years to get my first national diploma of basic competence in 2012 (brevet in French). From 2012, I joined Ibn Sina (better known as Avicenna) secondary school for two years and in 2016, I moved to Ibn Rochd (better known as Averroes) secondary school to prepare for my baccalaureate in the mathematics major. In 2016, I got my second national diploma (baccalaureate) with excellence (ranked 3<sup>rd</sup> regionally). <br><br> From a young age, it seems that I was naturally interested in science and curious about mathematics. During my school years, I succeeded to keep myself at the head of the classroom. Besides school, I was an active member in my community and interested in doing volunteer activities, like street, beach, and forest clean ups, helping with renovating children’s hospitals, participating in fundraising, and organizing donation events. These activities allowed me to mingle with many people sharing the same principles and values. During that period, I spent my time reading about scientific news, theology, personal development, and astronomy. In the local clubs, I was performing the popping-dance of Michael Jackson. I use to perform in local parties and trained some young people. This indirectly helped me get used to be on a stage and weakened my social phobia, which was useful for me during my academic career. I was additionally a frequent video game player and passionate about High-Tech. <br> My adolescence was also marked by the political transformations in my country. As a young, I have participated in large demonstrations that brought down the dictatorial system of Ben Ali. This gave me a spirit of freedom. Following the Tunisian revolution, I was drawn to the hip-hop movement emerging in my city, inspiring me to record few tracks that address youth rights and the nation’s political transition. <br><br><h4>University and moving to France</h4><hr><br> My journey at university started in 2016 in the faculty of sciences of Tunis where I started my Bachelor’s degree in fundamental physics. During my bachelor studies, I had many side activities. I was an active member in the Tunisian Association of Physics (STP), Tunisian Association of Science and Nuclear Consciousness (ATSCN), Astronomical Association of Tunisia (SAT), OSIRIS, and many other scientific clubs which gave me the opportunity to discover the research field and attend several conferences and seminars. <br><br> By 2019, I got my bachelor’s degree and being the first ranked on a national level, I got a scholarship to apply for a master in France. Indeed, in 2019, I moved to Rennes to start an international master’s degree in fundamental physics and applications (nanomaterials and nanotechnologies specialization) as part of a cooperation program between the universities of Rennes 1 and Nantes. Hence, I got a double diploma from both universities. <br> While pursuing my studies, I joined the sports club, and I had the opportunity to attend many scientific seminars and conferences. Taking courses in nano-physics and nano-characterization during my master, I was fascinated by the 2D field and attracted by the ability to elaborate 2Ds and characterize them, to understand experimentally their fundamental properties and seek for the promising applications that can take place. <br> I have also got some work experience by joining the university library as an assistant for 6 months. During my stay in Rennes, I enjoyed being in the university dorm where I got to know people from different cultures which was very enriching for my personal growth. I joined multiple clubs (social games, theater) and attended different social events. I am also a member of the French Physical Society (SFP). <br><br> As a part of my master’s degree, I moved - in February 2021 - to Grenoble to start my 6 month-internship at Grapheal Startup. By July 2021, I had graduated and earned my master’s degree, then I started applying to PhD programs in different French universities. Finally, I opted for a PhD at the university of Paris Saclay, and I joined the MAT2D group in the center of nanosciences and nanotechnologies (C2N) in Palaiseau (check the Experience tab). <br><br><h4>Moving to Switzerland</h4><hr><br> After getting my Ph.D, I moved to Fribourg to join Group Monney in the Departement of Physics in Fribourg University. <br><br> After my Postdoc, I plan on working as a researcher in either the field of education or R&D branch in a company. Beyond science, I find joy practicing dancing, sport, travelling, hiking, and volunteering (a member in several non-profit organizations). After being a deep video games during my teen age, I am now a casual player who enjoy nostalgic games. I am a huge fan of old soccer games and I use to stream some of the gameplay on YouTube. I am also interested in logic-based puzzle games like Sudoku and Sokoban. I recommend the following website if you want to try it. <a href=https://ksokoban.online/ target=_blank>https://ksokoban.online</a>. Additionally, I started to be interested in photography, I share some of my work on Flickr. <a href=https://www.flickr.com/people/201148868@N07/ target=_blank>https://www.flickr.com/people/201148868@N07/</a><br></p></div></section></body></html>
