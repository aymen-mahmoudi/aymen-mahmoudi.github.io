				My real professional experince started during the high school period, when I got the opportunity to
				assist to a numerous conferences and colloqorium. This allows me to meet several high rated people and
				deepen my relations with the personal in the research fields.

			<h4>Quantum emitters in 2D systems</h4>
			<i><a href="https://quantumlight-2d.sciencesconf.org/"
					target="_blank">https://quantumlight-2d.sciencesconf.org/</a></i>
			<br>
			This conference was held by the CRHEA in Antibes, Côte d'Azur (France) for three days. I have contributed by
			a poster.
			<br>
			During the event, I attended a bunch of talks dealing with quantum emission in 2D structures. It was a good
			program, to keep me updated with the promising properties of the quantum emitters and their integration in nanophotonic devices.
