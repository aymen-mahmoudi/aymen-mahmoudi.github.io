            My real professional experince started during the high school period, when I got the opportunity to
            assist to a numerous conferences and colloqorium. This allows me to meet several high rated people and
            deepen my relations with the personal in the research fields.

        This conference was held by the CRHEA in Antibes, CÃ´te d'Azur (France) for three days. I have contributed by
        a poster.

        During the event, I attended a bunch of talks dealing with quantum emission in 2D structures. It was a good
        program, to keep me updated with the promising properties of the quantum emitters and their integration in nanophotonic devices.
