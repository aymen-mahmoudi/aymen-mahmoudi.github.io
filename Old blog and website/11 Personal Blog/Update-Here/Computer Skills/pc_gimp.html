    <h1>GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)</h1>
</div>

    <p>GIMP is a free and open source cross-platform image editor. For me, it is the best free alternative of Photoshop (PS) Such software will be sufficient for the raster image manipulations we need in physics to deal with alternatively simple sketches. There is a huge debate about how GIMP is comparable to PS and according to me, I am not sure that it is as rich as Photoshop and Adobe's solutions are more advanced and complete for the deep learners or the field professional as the graphic designers. In addition, the Adobe cloud will be an unavoidable choice for you since it is the most demanded in the labor market (There is a free web based PS clone called Photopea if you are interested to start learning PS).

    Finally, I believe that GIMP is a very powerful alternative that cover the majority of Photoshop abilities and since I think that we have to privilege FOSS, I recommend learning GIMP specially if you are not aiming to perform very advanced tasks. The fact of being free made its learning more efficient.</p>
