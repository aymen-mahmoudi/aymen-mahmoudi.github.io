	<h1>Life and early academic</h1>

	 <h2>Early age</h2> 
	<p>I was born on February 01, 1997, in Menzel Bourguiba (or better know as Ferryville* : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menzel_Bourguiba), a little town of northern Tunisia where we enjoy being the highest dot in the afrian continent. </p>
	My life starts at 4 am on saturday then I enjoyed my first weekend. 

	<h3>Childhood and school</h3> 
	<p>Since my young age, it seems that I was naturally intersted in science and curious about mathematics. for all school yeras I have succeeded to keep myself in the head of the classroom. Besides school, I was interested in doing volunteer activities, then I was an active person in the young and culture houses in my city.  

	My adolescence was marked by the political transformations in my country following the demonstrations that brought down the system of Ben Ali.

	This gave me a spirit of freedom </p> 


	<h3>Bacculaureate</h3> 
	<p>The year of baccalaueate is an exceptional year </p> 

	<h3>Tunisian University</h3> 
	<p>My journey in the high school started in 2016 in the faculty of sciences of Tunis where I started my Licence degree </p>

	<h3>Travelling to France</h3>

	<p>In 2019, I passed to Rennes to start my master degree in the University of Rennes 1.
 </p>

	 <h3>Language</h3> 
	
	 <p>Arabic : As a Tunisian, Arabic is my mother tongue, I enjoy this languages since it allows to access to the culture of several countries in nortth Africa and middle east. This language is spoken by more than 300 millions persons (5th worldwide).</p>
	 <br>
	 French : In Tunisia, we start french courses in an early age and although the fact that I was not investing too much to learn languages and considering science as the unique subject worth to learn I still have an advanced level in french.
	 In 2018, I have passed an official language test called TCF_TP (French Fluency Test) from the French Institute in Tunis and I have got a C1 level certificate. Now and after being more than 3 years in France, my capacities become much better.
	 <br>
	 English : Considering the importance of the english language in the scientific area push me to put a lot of effort to learn this language. Besides the academic courses, I was always taking additional training in different languages centers and online to imrove my level. I got five certificates from different centers and I rate my level to be B2. In the near future, I plan to pass an official language test to identify exactly my level. 
	 <br>
	 German : Fianlly, I studied German for more than 2 years, I did not pass an official test but I estimate my level to be A1. Actually, I can understand a simple parargraph or a simple conversation but for the moment, I am putting this language on standby. 
	 <br>
	 Since I have family members in Germany, I started to visit the country periodicaaly since 2019. I was unable to hold a conversation at the first time but I become more familair.
	 I think that I will able to reactivate this language in case.


	 <h3>Hobbies</h3> 
	
	 <p>During my teenage years, I have practiced a lot of activities (pop-dancing, sport, hiking, volunteering, etc). Nowadays, I have different intersting. Since, I believe in the future of web3 and metaverse technologies, I enjoy my time exploring (and sometimes investing) the emerging project. I am also intersted in the global economic evolution and I enjoy trading some Forex pairs time to time.
