				<a href="https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/" target="_blank">The Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnology </a>  (C2N) is a joint research unit between the CNRS and Université Paris-Saclay (doctoral school EDPIF). It was founded in 2016 by merging two former laboratories and in 2018, the laboratory moved to a new building at the heart of Campus Paris-Saclay, in the south of Paris. I was well received by the <a href="https://mat2d.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/members/"
					target="_blank">MAT2D team members</a> who are interested in different kinds of bidimensional materials. My thesis page on Thése.fr website : <a href="https://www.theses.fr/s308409"target="_blank">https://www.theses.fr/s308409</a>
			</em>


			<br><br>
			During this thesis, I was integrated to the research and development team, composed of experts in
			material sciences. The main target was to study the propeties of 2Ds materials.
			<br>
			My PhD is a part of the theme of two-dimensional (2D) materials of atomic thickness which are nowadays
			considered with attention in view of future applications and more fundamental studies. In particular, this
			work is devoted to monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) MX<sub>2</sub> (M = Mo, W ; X =S,
			Se, Te). Due to their intrinsic band gap of about 1.1 to 1.9 eV, these materials are considered good
			candidates for field effect transistor (FET) devices.
			<br>
			By implementing microscopy and spectroscopy techniques such as Raman, photoemission and absorption
			spectroscopy, a study of the electronic, optical and structural properties of heterostructures composed of
			several 2D materials has been performed in order to provide a better understanding of these emerging
			systems.

			<br><br>
			<!-- <h2>Characterization facilities I used</h2>
			<hr> -->
			In order to investigte the optical properties of the 2D I got, I rely on Raman and Photoluminsence
			spectroscopy. Julien Chaste helped me with Raman spectroscopy and the transfer process of 2D materials. Indeed, 2D transfer techniques are essential to master to be able to build various heterostructures. During my Ph.D. I used both wet and dry methods to build to
			make 2D heterostructures. To mesure the thickness of my structures, another technique I am often using it is AFM, In our clean room, we
			use Brucker and ParkSystem machines. I performed also KPFM measurements on WSe<sub>2</sub> and InTe samples.
			<br>
			Thanks to the help of Fabrice Oehler, I got TEM data on the heterostructures I have. With him, we have
			transfered CVD grown flakes on carbon covered copper grid and performed TEM
			measurement on WSe<sub>2</sub>.
			<br>
			ARPES experimeent were a such part of my thesis, All the expirement I made were in the different beamline of
			Synchrotron Soleil in France (Cassioppée, Antares and Tempo). For the analysis part, I used IgorPro and Python based softwares (check the Computer skills tab). Using
			ARPES and XPS, I have investigated the band structure of the different vdW heterostructures I am dealing with.
			<!-- I got the opportunity to perform the acquisition myself in Cassioppee beamline. -->
			

			
			<br>
			PhD is certainly one of the most beautiful experience that a person can live. I express again my gratitude to all the people helped me to live it in suitable conditions.

				Based on several patents, the company is exploiting the potential and promising properties of graphene

			<!-- <u><h4>What I have learned</h4></u> -->

			<br><br>
			During this internship, I was integrated to the research and development team, composed of experts in
			material sciences, biochemistry, wireless electronics, cloud and software engineering. A part of my work was
			with the growing of graphene on copper via CVD facility. Another part of the work was related to the
			fabrication of GFET sensors integrating an innovative hybrid
			structure.
			<br>
			<br>
			With the engineer Riadh Othman, we grow high quality gaprhene on copper substrate. I used to perform wet
			transfer of graphene from the growth subsrtate (copper foil) to
			a polymer film of parylene or gold host substrate. The coppper is etched via different chemical solutions
			and many ways of transfer have been tested. I have succeeded to make a successful intercalation of a doping
			substance (viologen) between the graphene and parylene layers to increase the sensor sensitivity.
			<br>
			To ensure having a clean top graphene layer, we perform SEM measurements.
			<br>
			I worked also on the biochemistry part on the functionalization of the sensors which need the use of
			micro-chemistry facilities. To check on the state of the functionalization bodies, AFM mapping was a common
			tool I used.

			<br>
			This intership was a very important experience for me to familiarize with the cleanroom process and to be
			fully engaged with a team. Cetainly it was my first step to start a research carrer. I want to thank again
			Vincent Bouchiat and all the team members.

				emerging concepts in contemporary physics and in response to societal issues, with an increasingly
				important share of activities developed in the context of industrial partnerships.
			</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			My internship was conducted in the photoemission analysis laboratory under the supervision of Mrs.
			Ababou-Girard Soraya.
			During this experience, I was integrated in a small team with Gael Levanen (PhD student) and Nicolas
			Fournier Le Ray (M2-intership student) who are working on the development of electrochemical sensors for the
			detection of heavy metals for application to water treatment. In order to prepare the sensors, a
			functionalization step is necessary. At this level, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is necessary to ensure
			the fixation of ligand responsible for the detection and the chemical state of the surface after each
			functionalization step. In this context, I had the opportunity to participate in the preparation of samples
			and their transfer to the measurement chamber and in the acquisition and processing of data.
			<br>
			<br>
			First, through this intership, I got familiarized with the XPS technique and I was allowed to deepen my
			knowledge on the properties of X-rays, its uses and the physical phenomena involved in such photoemission
			experiment.
			<br>
			Second, this experience gave me the opportunity to initiate myself to the techniques of surface
			functionalization by chemical substances and it revealed to me the means of optimization and the
			experimental difficulties to be met during the preparation of the samples.
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally, I want to thank again Mrs. Ababou-Girard Soraya, Mr. Pascal Turban, Gael, Nico and all the members
			of IPR Institute for havin welcomed me. Without forgetting also all my classmates of my Master promotion
			2019/2021 that I had the pleasure to meet and work with them.

				certainly one of the major lab in the Tunisian physics research network. The work carried out focuses on
				the study of radiation emitted, in particular by stars, and the investigation of its optical properties
				based on spectral analysis techniques.
			</em>
			<br>
			<br>
			This intership was the first opportunity I get to be involved in a research environment. It was in the
			summer of 2019 after finishing my bachelor degree. During this experience, I worked on the analysis of radio
			frequencies triggered by lightning and the estimation of the distances to the sources using a very low
			frequency radio station. Indeed, we had a radio telescope type AWESOME (Atmospheric Weather Electromagnetic
			System for Observation Modeling and Education) provided by Stanford University in the framework of the
			International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI). This system is used for ELF-VLF data recording at our
			observation site (Tunis).
			<br>
			<br>
			A work of analysis of the collected signals must be carried out in order to extract the cut-off frequencies
			and the modes and to be able to estimate the distance to the source thereafter. It was a good opportunity to
			start analyzing the data using tools for wave analysis (Sonic Visualiser) and programming (Matlab, Python)
			<br>
			<br>
			Finally, I want to thank again Mr. Hassen Ghalila, Dr. Ahmed Ammar and all the members of LSAMA laboratory
			that I had the pleasure to meet. Without forgetting also all my classmates of my Bachelor promotion
			2016/2019 and all my prefessor of the faculy of sciences of Tunis, especially Mrs. Sonia Haddad, Mrs. Amel
			Ben Romdhane, Mr. Morad Telmini, Mr. Adel Trabelsi, etc.
