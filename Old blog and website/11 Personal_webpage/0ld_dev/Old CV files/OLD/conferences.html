				My real professional experience started during the high school period, when I got the opportunity to attend numerous conferences and colloquium. This allows me to meet several high rated people and deepen my relations with the personal in the research fields.

			<h2>Conferences</h2>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<h4>The GDR HOWDI colloquium 2023</h4>
			<i><a href="https://howdi2023.sciencesconf.org/"
					target="_blank">https://howdi2023.sciencesconf.org/</a></i>
			<br>
			This conference was held by the CNRS, Aix-Marseille University and the French Society of Physics (SFP) in Island of Porquerolles in France. I have contributed by an oral presentation.
			<br>
			The GDR is one of the most important events where the whole French and international community working on van der Waals materials gather. All fields related to these materials and their heterostructures will be covered: growth, characterization, transport, optics, spin, correlated states...

			<br><br>
			<h4>Quantum emitters in 2D systems</h4>
			<i><a href="https://quantumlight-2d.sciencesconf.org/"
					target="_blank">https://quantumlight-2d.sciencesconf.org/</a></i>
			<br>
			This conference was held by the CRHEA in Antibes, Côte d'Azur (France) for three days. I have contributed by
			a poster.
			<br>
			During the event, I attended a bunch of talks dealing with quantum emission in 2D structures. It was a good
			program, to keep me updated with the promising properties of the quantum emitters and their integration in nanophotonic devices.

			<br><br>
			<h4>30<sup>th</sup>Alain Bouyssy Colloquium</h4>

			<br>
			This colloqium was organized by the university of Paris-Saclay and the SFP in Orsay, FRANCE. I have contributed by a poster.
			<br>
			During th event, several conferences were held. I got the opportunity to interact with the undergratuated young student and help them about the possible academic cursus to follow.
			<br><br>
			<h4>RamanFest2022</h4>

			<br>
			Organized by HORIBA and PHANTOMS at Paris, France. I have contributed by a poster.
			<br>
			This conferences was a good opprtunity to attend presentations from world-leading Raman experts and meet researchers who are using different variants of the technique across varied applications. I enjoyed my time with the Raman community to share, learn and discuss how Raman spectroscopy is being applied.
