			<h4>Adolescence and schooling</h4>
			<hr>
			<br>
			I was born on February 1, 1997, in Menzel Bourguiba (better known as <a
				href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menzel_Bourguiba" target="_blank">Ferryville-7050</a> or
			Petit-Paris), a little town in northern Tunisia where we enjoy being the highest dot in the African
			continent with wonderful sunny weather and sandy beaches.
			My life started at 4 am on a Saturday when I enjoyed my first weekend :)</p>
			<br>
			I had an equilibrated childhood and I was a brilliant pupil at Sahnoon-II primary school in my hometown. By the age of 12, I started my studies at Ibn Charaf preparation school for three years to get my first
			national diploma of basic competence in 2012 (brevet in French). From 2012, I joined Ibn Sina (better known
			as Avicenna) secondary school for two years and in 2016,
			I moved to Ibn Rochd (better known as Averroes) secondary school to prepare for my baccalaureate in the
			mathematics major. In 2016,
			I got my second national diploma (baccalaureate) with excellence (ranked 3<sup>rd</sup> regionally).

			<br>


			From a young age, it seems that I was naturally interested in science and curious about mathematics.
			During my school years, I succeeded to keep myself at the head of the classroom. Besides school,
			I was an active member in my community and interested in doing volunteer activities, like street, beach, and
			forest clean ups,
			helping with renovating children’s hospitals, participating in fundraising,
			and organizing donation events. These activities allowed me to mingle with many people sharing the same
			principles and values.
			During that period, I spent my time reading about scientific news, theology, personal development, and
			astronomy.
			In the local clubs, I was performing the popping-dance of Michael Jackson. I had already performed at some
			local parties and trained some young people.
			I was additionally a frequent video game player and passionate about High-Tech.
			<br>
			My adolescence was also marked by the political transformations in my country following the demonstrations that brought down the system of Ben Ali. This gave me a spirit of freedom.




			<br><br>
			<h4>University and moving to France</h4>
			<hr>
			<br>
			My journey at university started in 2016 in the faculty of sciences of Tunis where I started my Bachelor’s
			degree in fundamental physics.
			During my bachelor studies, I had many side activities. I was an active member in the Tunisian Association
			of Physics STP,
			Tunisian Association of Science and Nuclear Consciousness ATSCN, Astronomical Association of Tunisia_SAT,
			OSIRIS, and many other scientific Clubs
			which gave me the opportunity to discover the research field and attend many conferences.
			<br>
			By 2019, I got my bachelor’s degree and being the first ranked on a national level, I got a scholarship to
			apply for a master in France.
			Indeed, in 2019, I moved to Rennes to start my master’s degree in nanosciences… at the University of Rennes.
			While pursuing my studies,
			I joined the sports club, and I had the opportunity to attend many scientific seminars and conferences.
			Taking courses in nano-physics and
			nano-characterization during my master, I was fascinated by the 2D domain and attracted by the ability to
			elaborate 2Ds and characterize them to study their fundamental properties.
			I also got some work experience by joining the university library as an assistant for 6 months.
			During my stay in Rennes, I enjoyed being in the university dorm where I got to know people from different
			cultures which was very enriching for
			my personal growth, and I joined many clubs (social games, theater) and attended several social events.
			<br>
			As a part of my master’s degree, I moved - in February 2021 - to Grenoble to start my 6 month-internship at
			Grapheal Startup.
			(Brief desc of the work)
			By July 2021, I had graduated and earned my master’s degree, then I started applying to PhD programs in
			different French universities. Finally, I opted for a PhD at the university of Paris Saclay, and I joined
			the MAT2D group in the center of nanosciences and nanotechnologies (C2N) in Palaiseau.
			<br>
			After graduating, I plan on working as a researcher in either the field of education or R&D branch in a
			company.





			<br><br>
			<h4>Languages</h4>
			<hr>
			<br>
			As a Tunisian, Arabic is my mother tongue. I enjoy this languages since it allows to access to the culture
			of several countries in nortth Africa and middle east. This language is spoken by more than 300 millions
			persons (5<sup>th</sup> worldwide).
			<br><br>
			In Tunisia, we start french courses in an early age in the primary school and the whole classes we got in
			the university are in french. In 2018, I have passed an official language test called TCF_TP (French Fluency Test) from the French
			Institute in Tunis and I have got a C1 level certificate. Now and after being more than 3 years in France,
			my capacities become much better.
			<br><br>
			Considering the importance of the english language in the scientific area push me to put a lot of effort in.
			Besides the academic courses, I was always taking additional training in different languages centers and
			online to imrove my level. I got five certificates from different centers and I rate my level to be B2. In
			the near future, I plan to pass an official language test to identify exactly my level.
			<br><br>
			Fianlly, I studied German for more than 2 years, I did not pass an official test but my level is estimated to be A1. Actually, I can understand a simple parargraph or a simple conversation. For the moment, I am not anymore taking courses but I think that I will able to reactivate this language in case.

			<br><br>
			<h4>Beyond science</h4>
			<hr>
					
			<br>
			I am also interested in the international politics, the geopolitical transformations and the mouvement in
			the global market. I am attracted by the philosophical and theological fields. I have recenly collected my thoughts about life and religions in a book (arabic version will be available soon).

			

			I find also joy practicing sport, travelling, hiking and volunteering. I am a member in the French red cross
			organization (donator num : 6144827)
			<br>
			<!-- After being a deep video games during my teen age. Now I start to be a casual player who enjoy nostalgic
			games. I enjoy also my beginner Djing skills (Using Hercules gear, I can perform patching syncing and sampling). 
			especially PES6 and I am sharing some streaming on my personal Youtube channel : link..</p> -->
			I am also a rookie painter : <i><a
					href="https://filedn.eu/lURhr7yoDog5QqszLEQkrtu/aymen-mahmoudi.xyz/painting/" target="_blank">link
					to painting folder</a></i>
					<br>
			Finally, since I am highly interested in sharing knowledge, I created the mahmoudi4physics.net plateform (still digital and underconstruction) to help and share knowledge about physics, programming and softwares.
