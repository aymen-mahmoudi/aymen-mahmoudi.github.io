      Requiring some level of computer proficiency can help to enhance the work quality and automate routine tasks.
      Practicing programming contribute to the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In the
      following, I list the computer tools I use.
      <br>
      I am in continuous learning of those tools by taking online courses from different platforms and instructors.
      <br><br>

      <h3>Python</h3>
      <hr>
      Python is a high-level programming language which is becoming increasingly popular in last years.
      I discovered it through my L3 intersip in 2019 and then I started more and more rely on it for my common digital
      activities.
      <br>
      I am using a variety of libraries. Mainly NumPy (SciPy) for mathematical calculation, Pandas for data framing,
      Matplotlib (and Seaborn) for 2/3D plotting, OpenCV (and PIL) for image processing and several other libraries for various tasks.
      <br>
      For the gui dev application, I had experience with tkinter and a slight one with pygame but I have after focused on pyQt framework.
      <br><br>
      <u>Data Analysis : </u>For data analysis purposes, I rely on Pandas package for cleansing and processing and on Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly for visualization.
      <br>
      <u>Machine Learning : </u>I am still learning the ML packages under Python : PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn and Keras.
      <br><br>
      <i>I am always learninig about the language but I assume having a good level since I am able to
        troubleshoot problems on my own, and use my previous experience to solve novel problems. Have a look on my Gitlab profile to check the scripts I share.</i>

      I start using C/C++ during my M1 to run some codes under Code::Blocks IDE. For the moment, I ditched C++ for
      Python but I keep it in case I need to optimize the speed of the scripts I run on Python.
      <br>
      <div class="skill_rating">I have a good level</div>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Arduino</h3>

      <h3>More skills to acquire soon</h3>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li>Beyond Arduino I am motivated to start some Raspberry Pi and LabVIEW for more sophisticated tasks.</li>
        <li>COMSOL also is a great tool for physics-based models and simulation applications I want to learn in the nearest occasion.</li>
        <li>To increase my capacities in data analysis, SQL and R can be also helpful. For more enhanced report quality, acquiring additional tool for visualization and Dashbooard creation (Google Data Studio, Power BI or Tableau) will be also a good idea.I have got some online crash courses on G-data Studio and Power BI, but I have not worked on real projects using these tools. I will be happy getting the occasion to practice more these tools.</li>
      </ul>
