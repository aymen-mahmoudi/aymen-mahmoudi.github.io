            Certainly, the PhD is one of the best journey a person can experience. I am very glad to have this
            opportunity and be involved in such experience.
            <br>
            I have started my Ph.D. trip at the <a href="https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/"
                target="_blank">Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies C2N</a> in Palaiseau. CNRS-FRANCE. I am
            well received by the <a href="https://mat2d.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/members/"
                target="_blank">MAT2D team members</a> who are interested in different kinds of bidimensional materials.
            <br>
            My thesis page on Thése.fr website : <a href="https://www.theses.fr/s308409"
                target="_blank">https://www.theses.fr/s308409</a>
            <br>
            <br>
            My PhD is a part of the theme of two-dimensional (2D) materials of atomic thickness which are nowadays
            considered with attention in view of future applications and more fundamental studies. In particular, this
            work is devoted to monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) MX<sub>2</sub> (M = Mo, W ; X =S, Se, Te). Due to their intrinsic band gap of about 1.1 to 1.9 eV, these materials are considered good candidates for field effect transistor (FET) devices.
            <br>
            By implementing microscopy and spectroscopy techniques such as Raman, photoemission and absorption spectroscopy, a study of the electronic, optical and structural properties of heterostructures composed of several 2D materials has been performed in order to provide a better understanding of these emerging systems.

            <h2>Characterization facilities I used</h2>
            <hr>
            <br> 
            In this section, I will list the most important skills I earned through my Ph.D. as well as the experiments I have done.
            <br><br>
            <h4>Optical spectroscopy</h4>
            For optically characterizing the 2D flakes I use Raman and Photoluminsence very often.
            <br><br>
            <h4>AFM</h4>
            Another technique I am often using it is AFM, In our clean room, we use Brucker and ParkSystem machines.
            <br><br>
            <h4>TEM</h4>
            Thanks to the help of Fabrice Oehler, I got TEM data on the heterostructures I have. With him, we have transfered CVD grown flakes on carbon covered copper grid and performed TEM
            measurement on WSe<sub>2</sub>.
            <br><br>
            <h4>2D transfer techniques</h4>
            2D transfer techniques are essential to master. During my Ph.D. I used both wet and dry methods to build to make 2D heterostructures
            <br><br>
            <h4>ARPES</h4>
            ARPES experimeent were a such part of my thesis, All the expirement I made were in the different beamline of Synchrotron Soleil in France (Cassioppée, Antares and Tempo).
            <!-- I got the opportunity to perform the acquisition myself in Cassioppee beamline. -->
            For the analysis part, I used IgorPro and Python based softwares (check the Computer skills tab). Using ARPES and XPS, I have investigated the band structure of the different vdW heterostructures I am dealing with.

            <br>
            PhD is certainly one of the most beautiful experience that a person can live. Through this next lines, I
            will try to express my gratitude to all the people helped me to live it in suitable conditions.

            <h4>Fabrice Ohler</h4>
            Fabrice is a permanent researcher in the MAT2D team. During my thesis, he was my provider for all tungsten deselenide flakes I used. I recongnise also his support, the intersted discussions we had and his help with VESTA software, SEM and XRD.
            

            <br><br>
            <h4>Julien Chaste</h4>

            Julien is a permanent researcher in the MAT2D team. During my thesis, he basically helped me with Raman
            spectroscopy and the transfer process of 2D materials. I recongnise also the discussions we had about my
            work as well as about life.

            During this period, I had the pleasure to be at his side and gain expertice. My first real intraction with a
            beamline environment was with Geoffroy in Cassioppe in 2021.
