    <h1>Movies</h1>
</div>

    <p>In this section, I recommend some good movies that include mathematicians and physicists.</p>

    <h2>The martian</h2>
    <p>With this film, we discover the story of Mark Watney, who is left behind by his crew after a fierce storm. Stranded and presumed dead, Watney faces the ultimate test of survival as he battles the harsh Martian environment, relying on his ingenuity, scientific knowledge, and sheer determination to stay alive. Meanwhile, back on Earth, NASA and Watney's crewmates work tirelessly to bring him home, showcasing the power of human resilience, teamwork, and innovation. With breathtaking visuals and a captivating storyline, "The Martian" celebrates the indomitable spirit of exploration and the triumph of the human will.</p>
            
    <h2>The man who knew infinity</h2>
    <p>This problem was posed by the Austrian mathematician Leo Moser in 1966 and it still unsolved. The problem is the following: what is the shape of largest area in </p>

    <h2>The beautiful mind</h2>

    <h2>Gravity</h2>
    <p>In "Gravity", we embark on a harrowing journey in outer space alongside Dr. Ryan Stone, and astronaut Matt Kowalski. We find ourselves stranded in orbit after our space shuttle is destroyed by debris. With communication lost and oxygen running out, we must rely on our training and resourcefulness to navigate the unforgiving vacuum of space and find a way back to Earth. As we face one obstacle after another, including dwindling resources and the vast emptiness of space, the film explores themes of resilience, isolation, and the indomitable human spirit. With breathtaking visuals and heart-pounding suspense, "Gravity" immerses us in a visceral tale of survival against the backdrop of the cosmos.

    <h2>Oppenheimer</h2>
    <p>In "Oppenheimer," we delve into the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who played a central role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. Through Nolan's lens, we are transported to the turbulent years of the Manhattan Project, where Oppenheimer and his team race against time to unlock the secrets of atomic energy. As we follow Oppenheimer's journey from scientific idealism to moral introspection, we confront profound questions about the consequences of scientific discovery and the complexities of human ambition. With Nolan's signature blend of visual spectacle and cerebral storytelling, "Oppenheimer" promises to be a thought-provoking exploration of one of the most consequential figures of the 20th century.
